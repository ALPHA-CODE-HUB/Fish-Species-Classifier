# Fish Species Classification using Vision Transformer and VGG16

This project implements a hybrid deep learning model that combines a Vision Transformer (ViT) and VGG16 to classify fish species from images. The model leverages the complementary strengths of both architectures to achieve high classification accuracy.

## Model Architecture

The model uses a combination of two powerful vision architectures:

1. **VGG16**: A classic convolutional neural network pretrained on ImageNet, providing robust feature extraction capabilities.
2. **Vision Transformer (ViT)**: A transformer-based architecture that processes image patches as sequences, capturing global relationships within images.

These two feature extractors are combined through:
- Global average pooling layers to reduce dimensions
- Dense layers with ReLU activation and dropout for regularization
- A final softmax layer for classification

## Dataset

The model was trained on the [Fish Species Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sripaadsrinivasan/fish-species-image-data), focusing on the top 10 most common species:
- Bodianus
- Cephalopholis
- Cirrhilabrus
- Coris
- Epinephelus
- Halichoeres
- Lethrinus
- Lutjanus
- Pseudanthias
- Thalassoma

## Training Details

- **Data Preprocessing**: Images were resized to 224Ã—224 pixels and normalized
- **Data Augmentation**: Rotation, shifting, shearing, zooming, and horizontal flipping
- **Training Strategy**: 20 epochs with Adam optimizer (learning rate = 0.0001)
- **Batch Size**: 32
- **Loss Function**: Sparse categorical crossentropy

## Performance Metrics

The model achieved excellent performance with:
- **Test Accuracy**: 91%
- **Average AUC**: 0.99 (across all classes)

| Thalassoma   | 0.96      | 0.80   | 0.87     | 30      |
| **Macro Avg**| 0.93      | 0.90   | 0.91     | 347     |
| **Weighted Avg**| 0.92   | 0.91   | 0.91     | 347     |

## Key Findings

1. **Class Performance**: The model performed exceptionally well on most classes, with Lethrinus achieving a perfect recall score of 1.00 and Cirrhilabrus achieving a precision of 1.00.

2. **Confusion Patterns**: The confusion matrix reveals that:
   - Bodianus is occasionally confused with Epinephelus
   - Thalassoma shows some confusion with Halichoeres
   - Most other species have minimal confusion with accuracy above 85%

3. **Model Convergence**: Training and validation curves show good convergence with minimal overfitting. The model achieves over 90% accuracy on the training set and approximately 89% on the validation set.

4. **ROC Curves**: All classes demonstrate excellent ROC curves with AUC values between 0.98-1.00, indicating the model's strong discriminative ability across all species.

5. **Precision-Recall Performance**: The precision-recall curves show that the model maintains high precision even as recall increases, with average precision scores above 0.89 for all classes.
